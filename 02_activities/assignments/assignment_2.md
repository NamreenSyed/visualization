# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

 I think the HR Attrition Dashboard visual is a good one for the following reasons:

1. It follows a simple color scheme, which is accessible to those on the spectrum for color blindness.
2. It uses a variety of familiar visual graphics such as pie charts, tables, and bar graphs, which most people have a general knowledge of how to read.
3. The entire visual uses one font style, which reduces cognitive load.
4. The data is clearly organized into various variables for attrition and retention, such as age, gender, education, department, job role, year and month, and employment survey results.
5. There are individual examples of recent attrition, which combine variables such as income, role, department, and satisfaction score.

I think the AI in Design Data Visual is an example of a poor visual for the following reasons:

1. In an attempt to create light-heartedness around a subject that may be daunting, the visualizer has used caricatures and squiggles that actually make a mockery of a serious topic.
2. The caricatures, figures, font, and squiggles create cognitive load and make it hard to follow the message, especially for neurodiverse individuals who may get lost in deciphering the visual.
3. There are too many font styles and types, including awkward capitalizations.
4. The visual also uses inaccurate and uninviting terminology, e.g., calling humans "awkward squishy bags of emotion" instead of "emotionally intelligent" or those "having socio-cultural context," etc.
5. The visual also oversimplifies AI, effectively calling it "boring" and "inside the box," thus failing to capture the creative potential and leverage that AI offers.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
 Areas for improvement for HR Attrition visual:

1. Survey Score Section: The color coding here is not clear and does not follow the key of 'retention' and 'attrition'. It is not entirely clear what the shades of orange and grey represent.
2. Age Group: It is not clear in this section if the attrition is shown as a subset (with an accurate visual to scale depiction) of the total employees within the age group.
3. It is unclear what this visual aims to achieve or what story it aims to tell, as it is hard to draw any conclusions from the information provided here. The reasons for leaving the company are not listed and may be multifaceted and complex for each individual.

Areas for improvement for the AI visual:

1. Instead of labeling work or computers as 'boring' or humans as 'irrational squishy bags of emotion,' opt for more precise language.
2. Remove the grey shadow under some of the characters to decrease cognitive load.
3. Use one font type throughout the document.
4. Try using a uniform caricature for human and AI representations, instead of having a new variation every time. This will make it easier to immediately understand that it's a comparison of human and AI skills.
4. Increasing the space between each level of the hierarchy will improve the understanding that each step represents a different argument.
5. Avoid excessive squiggly arrowsâ€”aim for a balance between making it light-hearted and avoiding a cartoonish feel.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
